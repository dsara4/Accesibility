New Sight is an app that uses an object detection machine learning program from TensorFlow Lite, to process images from your camera in real-time and identify what's in the image. Objects being identified will have a coloured frame around it with its name written above the frame. The app then says the name of the object it's focusing on out loud, using Text-to-speech.

This prototype was built to help those with impaired vision, learn about their surroundings better.
